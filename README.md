# Crypto-based Loyalty Card

A decentralized loyalty rewards system built on the Aptos blockchain that revolutionizes traditional customer loyalty programs through transparent, secure, and interoperable smart contracts.

## Description of the Project

The Crypto-based Loyalty Card project is a blockchain-powered loyalty rewards system that enables merchants and customers to participate in a transparent, decentralized loyalty ecosystem. Built using Aptos Move smart contracts, this system allows customers to:

- **Earn Points**: Automatically receive loyalty points for every purchase (1 point per AptosCoin spent)
- **Redeem Rewards**: Use accumulated points as discounts on future purchases (1 point = 0.01 AptosCoin discount)
- **Tier Progression**: Advance through loyalty tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) based on total spending
- **Transparent Tracking**: All transactions and point balances are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency

### Key Features:
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the loyalty points
- **Transparent**: All transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Interoperable**: Can be integrated across multiple merchants and platforms
- **Secure**: Blockchain-based security prevents fraud and double-spending
- **Automatic Tier Management**: Smart contract automatically upgrades user tiers based on spending

## Vision of the Project
